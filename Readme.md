####Questions you may have:

__What are .xaf files?__  
As far as this application is concerned, .xaf files are 3ds Max animations exported to XML format.

__How is this version different from the previous version?__  
The first version of this application exported the Position and LookDirection of one camera object only. As such, that version expected the .xaf file to contain one camera object only. This version will export animations for all objects present in the .xaf file
